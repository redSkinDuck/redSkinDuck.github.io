# working experience

- company: Alibaba Cloud (Full-time)
  position: Senior Software Development Engineer, Optimizer and SQL Group, PolarDB, Database BU
  duration: July, 2020 &mdash; Present
  projects:
    - project: AI Based Plan Hint Generation
      summary: 
        <ul class="resume-item-list">
          <li>
            Developed an AI-based system for database query optimization using XGBoost and decision trees. The SQL Plan Management system initially caches the current execution plans and AI model generates alternative plans for evaluation. Background execution of these AI-generated plans in standby nodes allows performance comparison, and superior plans automatically replace the original.
          </li>
        </ul>
    - project: Command Offloading Framework
      summary: 
        <ul class="resume-item-list">
          <li>
            Design and implement an offloading framework that enables the system to execute the collection of statistics in standby instance and the background execution for performance validation, which saves the computing power of master instance for execution of queries. 
          </li>
        </ul>
    - project: SQL Plan Management (SPM) Module
      summary: 
        <ul class="resume-item-list">
          <li>
            Developed an SPM module to stabilize execution plans and enhance query performance. The module ensured plan stability while leveraging idle system time to execute and evaluate alternative plans in the background, enabling continuous optimization without disrupting active operations.            
          </li>
        </ul>
    - project: Statement Outline
      summary: 
        <ul class="resume-item-list">
          <li>
            Developed the Statement Outline feature, enabling developers to manually add hints to specific queries to correct suboptimal execution plans. Widely adopted in production environments, this tool improved plan stability and addressed optimizer-generated inefficiencies.
          </li>
        </ul>

  position: Software Development Engineer Intern, Optimizer & SQL Group, PolarDB, Database BU
  duration: May 2019 &mdash; August 2019
  projects:
  - project: MySQL build-in test framework improvement
    summary: 
      <ul class="resume-item-list">
        <li>
          Improve the result masking of mysql-test, the built-in test framework of MySQL. It implements matching of regex in specific column of result, which is used to the test features whose result is not stable but follows some pattern.
        </li>
      </ul>
  - project: Memory Allocation Optimization
    summary:
      <ul class="resume-item-list">
        <li>
          Survey popular implementations of general purpose malloc, like jemalloc and tcmalloc. A patent is panding about it.
        </li>
