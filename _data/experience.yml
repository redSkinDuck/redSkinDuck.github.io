    - project: Improved bounds of optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes
      duration: Jun, 2021 &mdash; Feb, 2022
      summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Locally repairable codes (LRCs) are a class of codes widely used in distributed storage systems that optimize repair locality. Traditional r-LRCs could only recover a single erased symbol of codeword by assessing at most r other symbols in each local repair block; we analyzed the generalized LRCs of (r,&#948)-locality with optimal minimum Hamming distance to tolerate multiple node failures.</li><li>Significantly improved the upper bound with weaker assumptions on the code length n of linear LRCs that is tight in at least three special cases, including d = 2&#948+2 and d = 2&#948+1 where d denotes the minimum distance; this bound can be exactly achieved in the above cases by existing constructions.</li><li>Provided an equivalent existence condition for the optimal (r=2,&#948)-LRCs with disjoint local subcodes using the parity-check matrix approach and restated the existence condition via finite projective planes using the sunflower construction technique from Galois geometry.</li><li>Introduced a framework for future research on the maximum code length and constructions of optimal (r,&#948)-LRCs with small localities in which fewer symbols are required for recovery of the failure nodes.</li><li>Contributed as third-author to the paper, “Some Results on the Improved Bound and Construction of Optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes”, published at the IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications, 2022.</li></ul>

      summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Constructing optimal (r,&#948)-locally repairable codes (LRCs) that achieve maximal code length for d > 3&#948 remains a challenge; for this project, we consider the setting of optimal (r,&#948)-LRCs with d = 3&#948+3.</li><li>Proposed a novel algebraic-geometry-based general construction technique for constructing (r,&#948)-LRCs that exactly achieve the longest possible code length of n=(&#948+1)(q+1) as given by the generalized Singleton-type bound for d = 3&#948+3.</li><li>Obtained a tighter upper bound on the code length n for optimal (n, k, d=3, &#948+3; r=2, &#948)-LRCs using similar methodological underpinnings of the line-point incidence matrix and the Johnson bounds for constant weight codes; the proof combines ideas from both algebra and geometry.</li><li>Derived an upper bound on the number of rows in the line-point incident matrix by partitioning the matrix via the matrix transformation technique and utilizing the resulting intersection condition on the lines given by our proposed geometric characterization of optimal (n, k, d = 3&#948 + 3; r=2, &#948)-LRCs.</li><li>Contributed as first author to the manuscript, “Improved Bounds and Optimal Constructions of (r, &#948)-LRCs with Minimum Distance 3&#948+3”, submitted to IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory.</li></ul>

    - project: Neural machine translation with global and local attention
      duration: Jan, 2020 &mdash; Feb, 2020
      summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>The attention mechanism is a procedure proposed for encoder-decoder type neural networks to improve the performance of sentence level prediction tasks. The mechanism incentivizes the network to make alignment decisions based on the most relevant parts of the input sequence using attentional hidden states.</li><li>Analyzed the specific advantages and disadvantages of various attentional architectures, including multi-head attention, self-attention, and hierarchical attention.</li><li>Designed and implemented in PyTorch local attention-based and global attention-based seq2seq models, each with four long short term memory (LSTM) layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting; global attention is a mechanism that consider all the hidden states when deriving the context vector, while local attention considers only a subset of hidden states, thereby resolving the problem of excessive computational costs resulted from global attention.</li><li>Fine-tuned model parameters, including number of hidden layers and number of hidden units per layer; preprocessed and evaluated model performance in terms of BLEU score with brevity penalty on the IWSLT2015 English-Vietnamese dataset comprising of ~130,000 sentences in the training set and ~1,200 sentences in the test set.</li><li>Achieved a BLEU score of 17.6 on the IWSLT2015 English-Vietnamese test set; concluded that the proposed model is suitable for capturing long-distance dependencies between words.</li></ul>

      summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Freiman and Scourfield proved that any large enough natural number n can be written as the sum of certain integers of even ascending powers. We are interested in the smallest number of even-ascending-powered integers such that n can be decomposed into.</li><li>Defined Farey dissection and major arcs-arcs that satisfy specific inequalities-and estimated contribution of minor arcs.Approximated analytic generating functions-the associated Fourier coefficients to a specific function on the partition of even indices-on major arcs by their arithmetic counterparts and provided an approximation error bound using the pruning lemma.</li><li>Pruned the major arcs to logarithmically scaled major arcs and obtained the associated the minor arcs. Showed that every expected error term can be bounded by something negligible, thus allowing us to focus on the main term in the expression.</li><li>Proved that any large enough natural number n can be written as the sum of 71 even ascending powers.</li><li>Contributed to a manuscript entitled “An explicit bound on the number of sums of even ascending powers”, to be submitted to Journal of Number Theory.</li></ul>
